      <h4>Description</h4>

  <p>   Decision theory tells us that there are two basic components to any
decision, namely the uncertainty, quantified as probability, of the
possible outcomes and the desirability, quantified as utility, of
these outcomes.

In this project, we focus on features relating to utility. The topic
is very broad, and there are many different aspects that you might
choose to study. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the features
that we have in mind.
 </p> 
          
<ol type="i">
<li> We may consider any utility as comprising a collection of
attributes (for example, costs and benefits). Each attribute may
itself be comprised of attributes (for example, costs may be financial
and ethical, benefits may be individual and communal and so
forth). Under assumptions of utility independence, the collection of
attributes can be organised into a utility hierarchy leading to a
methodology for the assessment of overall utility for any choice.
</li>
<li> Utility hierarchies require the specification of trade-offs
between the various attributes (i.e. how do we value the relative
importance of financial and ethical costs). Often we will not be able
to make precise specifications of such trade-offs (for example, the
utility might represent the conflicting judgements of a group of
decision makers with different priorities), leading to the
specification of imprecise utility functions, and the development of
the theory for appropriate decision making in such cases.
</li>
<li> Preferences may be time dependent (for example, how do we
evaluate receiving a reward now against receiving the same reward in a
year's time). This leads to the theory of time discounted utility.
</li>
<li> In some problems, we may not be sure about our utility for a
reward until we receive that reward (for example, we may not know how
much we like a particular type of cheese until we receive and taste a
portion of that cheese). This leads to the theory of adaptive utility,
in which we learn about our utility over time.
</li>
<li> We may explore alternatives to utility maximisation, both
descriptively (how do people actually make decisions) or normatively
(how should people make decisions) which leads to areas such as
prospect theory.
</li>
<li> Any of these features may be combined and placed in a statistical
context, in which, for example, our decision might be to choose an
experiment with benefits derived from increased knowledge and costs
derived from the expense and effort of the experiment.
</li>
</ol>

           <p> 
For any of these areas, you might study and report on existing theory,
develop new special cases and/or apply the theory to examples real or
constructed.

<h4>Further information</h4>
<p> 
You will find much information online when googling for `Utility
Theory', specific topic areas or similar key words, and there are many
relevant books in the library and journals (online via the Durham
University Library). Please feel free to contact by email if you are
interested in particular ways to link this area to your wider
interests.
